  abstract  = {In recent years, various heuristic optimization methods have been developed. Many of these methods are inspired by swarm behaviors in nature. In this paper, a new optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity and mass interactions is introduced. In the proposed algorithm, the searcher agents are a collection of masses which interact with each other based on the Newtonian gravity and the laws of motion. The proposed method has been compared with some well-known heuristic search methods. The obtained results confirm the high performance of the proposed method in solving various nonlinear functions.},

  abstract  = {Security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) is a key operation function for modern power systems. In this study, a new bi-level optimisation approach is proposed to solve this problem considering a comprehensive SCOPF model, including, for example, valve loading effect, multi-fuel option and prohibited operating zone constraints of thermal units as well as AC network modelling and AC security constraints. Economic dispatch is solved in the lower level of the proposed approach and using its results as the initial solution, SCOPF is solved in the upper level with high convergence rate. For the both levels, a new enhanced gravitational search algorithm is suggested as the optimisation tool. The proposed bi-level approach is tested on 9-bus, IEEE 57-bus, IEEE 118-bus, IEEE 300-bus and polish 2746-bus test systems. Obtained results from the proposed approach for the test cases are compared with the results of other SCOPF solution methods and published literature figures. These comparisons confirm the validity of the developed approach.},

  abstract  = {One heuristic evolutionary algorithm recently proposed is the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), inspired by the gravitational forces between masses in nature. This algorithm has demonstrated superior performance among other well-known heuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimisation and genetic algorithm. However, slow exploitation is a major weakness that might result in degraded performance when dealing with real engineering problems. Due to the cumulative effect of the fitness function on mass in GSA, masses get heavier and heavier over the course of iteration. This causes masses to remain in close proximity and neutralise the gravitational forces of each other in later iterations, preventing them from rapidly exploiting the optimum. In this study, the best mass is archived and utilised to accelerate the exploitation phase, ameliorating this weakness. The proposed method is tested on 25 unconstrained benchmark functions with six different scales provided by CEC 2005. In addition, two classical, constrained, engineering design problems, namely welded beam and tension spring, are also employed to investigate the efficiency of the proposed method in real constrained problems. The results of benchmark and classical engineering problems demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},
