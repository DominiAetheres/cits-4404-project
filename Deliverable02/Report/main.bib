  abstract  = {In recent years, various heuristic optimization methods have been developed. Many of these methods are inspired by swarm behaviors in nature. In this paper, a new optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity and mass interactions is introduced. In the proposed algorithm, the searcher agents are a collection of masses which interact with each other based on the Newtonian gravity and the laws of motion. The proposed method has been compared with some well-known heuristic search methods. The obtained results confirm the high performance of the proposed method in solving various nonlinear functions.},
